    <h1>Terms of Service for Mepa</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: December 18, 2025</p>

    <p>By adding the Mepa Discord Bot ("Bot") to your server or using its services, you agree to be bound by these Terms
        of Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of Service</h2>
    <p>Mepa is a Discord bot designed for entertainment, moderation, and community engagement. You agree not to use the
        Bot for any illegal purposes or in a way that violates Discord's own Terms of Service.</p>

    <h2>2. User Content</h2>
    <p>The Bot may process messages sent in channels it has access to. By using the Bot, you grant us permission to
        process this content locally for the purpose of providing bot functionality (e.g., AI responses, moderation).
    </p>

    <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The Bot is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We are not responsible for any damages or data loss
        resulting from the use of the Bot. Mepa's AI responses are generated by third-party models (Google Gemini) and
        may not always be accurate or appropriate.</p>

    <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall the developers of Mepa be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential
        damages appearing out of the use of the Bot.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of the
        new terms.</p>
